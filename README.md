# SAN Storage Failover & Failback PowerShell Script Template for Failover Cluster

**Note**: This is a template to ease development. The storage-vendor-specific part of the scripts have to be coded by yourself.

There sometimes comes a need to simplify complex operations, in this case failover and failback operations of SAN storage replication between sites (e.g. production and DR), for reasons such as letting operators or the less technically-confident colleagues to more easily perform the operations in case of disasters or drill tests. To achieve that, this template has been created.

Written primarily in PowerShell, this package contains a set of SAN storage failover and failback scripts for Microsoft Failover Cluster (including Hyper-V cluster) and vendor-neutral pseudo code for SAN storage (for further modification to support different SAN vendors). Not only does it perform storage failover and failback, services running on top of it such as databases and virtual machines can also be catered.

Moreover, it features a user-friendly interactive console menu, where complex operations are handled by the scripts in the backend.

Served as a general template for implementation, one has to fill in the blanks – SAN-vendor-specific commands – to fit for his/her own use. Although the Failover Cluster parts and the interactive console menu are already there, further coding and testing cannot be avoided.

The scripts were designed to be as reusable (e.g. parameterized) as possible, in order to allow me to more easily adapt it to fit different projects. It has also been released as an open-source project on the GitHub repository [ws-storage-failover](https://github.com/wandersick/ws-storage-failover) which encourages IT pros to fork it to for their own SAN storage systems, and if possible, contribute their modified bits in returns, assisting others who might want to implement it for their own choice of SAN storage systems.

# Features

- Script failover and failback between replicated SAN storage with Microsoft Failover Cluster (Hyper-V and others)
- Operator-friendly interactive console menus through which failover, failback and validation, status reporting can be performed
- Steps can be performed individually or all at once
- Scripted in PowerShell (Windows operations) and pseudo code (SAN-specific operations) as a template to be modified or customized
- Define variables or fill in parameters in SAN-Parameters.xml and SAN-Parameters.ps1
- Pseudo code of SAN operations is provided inside &lt;# #&gt; inline comment blocks to be replaced as required per command-line reference of SAN storage
- Speed up development of automated/manual SAN failover/failback with this set of scripts
- Leverage the command-line interface usually provided by SAN storage systems over SSH which makes it possible to use plink.exe (from PuTTY) to command SAN storage systems in scripts
- Default scenario is for storage systems located in two sites with SAN-level replication
- Console outputs are logged under Logs folder, with error messages separately stored
- Open-source project on GitHub, encouraging forking

# Requirements

- SAN storage systems with SAN replication enabled (2 sites – production and DR sites assumed) with hosts running Failover Cluster (e.g. Hyper-V) in each site
- A Windows client that runs the console menu with PowerShell 3.0 or above (comes with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2)
- [PuTTY](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14-Iv8byPYI9dq6dQVg3UOBJEVy0tgC3X/view?usp=sharing) should be installed under a location specified in SAN-Parameters.ps1
- A one-time authentication may be required by connecting to SAN storage systems in both sites via SSH (with PuTTY or plink.exe) in order to cache the host key in registry
- Run PowerShell as Administrator prior to running the Console Menu script

# Getting Started

1. Edit SAN-Parameters.ps1 and .xml files for options such as changing the user account for SSH communication with your SAN.
2. All pseudo code (SAN-specific operations) inside &lt;# #&gt; should be replaced with the implementation of your SAN vendor. For example, change _Echo &lt;# display LUN #&gt;_ to the actual command _lsvdisk_ (IBM/Lenovo Storwize), _lun show_ (NetApp), _volcoll_ (HPE Nimble), etc.
3. Perform further development or customization according to your needs. For example:
  - Follow the comments in the script
  - Names of functions, variables and echo messages are self-explanatory

# Limitations

- There is no one-size-fits-all solution – modification is inevitable
- Not all error messages are separately recorded in error log file; some errors only exist in the main log. Outputs and errors encountered in the menu are not logged
- SAN storage credentials are stored in the ps1 configuration file in clear text (protect the file properly)
